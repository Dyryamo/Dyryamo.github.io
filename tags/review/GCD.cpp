/*    The greatest common divisor GCD(a,b) of two positive integers a and b,sometimes written (a,b),is the largest divisor common to a and b,For example,(1,2)=1,(12,18)=6.
    (a,b) can be easily found by the Euclidean algorithm. Now Carp is considering a little more difficult problem:
    Given integers N and M,please answer sum of  X satisfies 1<=X<=N and (X,N)>=M.

输入
    The first line of input is an integer T(T<=100) representing the number of test cases. The following T lines each contains two numbers N and M (1<=N<=10^9, 1<=M<=10^9), representing a test case.
输出
    Output the answer mod 1000000007
